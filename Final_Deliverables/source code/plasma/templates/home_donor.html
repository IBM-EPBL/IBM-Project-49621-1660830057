        <h2 class="py-4">Who Do Plasma Donations Help?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            Individuals who experience a severe trauma, burn or shock often lose a significant amount of
            blood volume, and are
            depleted of many necessary electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals that help to balance the
            amount of water, nutrients
            and pH level inside the body. In this situation, a plasma transfusion can provide the lifesaving
            blood volume needed to
            restore their blood pressure and volume status, as well as restore electrolyte levels.

            In addition, people with liver disease or clotting factor deficiencies may not have the proper
            substances in their blood
            to allow their blood to clot normally. Whenever an individual has a cut or injury, these
            clotting factors ensure that
            they do not lose too much blood. Plasma donations ensure that these individuals can receive a
            plasma transfusion to
            supplement their body’s clotting ability and stop excessive bleeding from occurring. Finally,
            children and adults with
            cancer sometimes experience complications in which their body has used up all of their natural
            clotting factors. In
            cases of this disorder, called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), transfusions of
            fresh frozen plasma may be
            critical.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is The Plasma Donation Process?</h2>
        <p class="lead">


            During a plasma donation, blood is removed from the donor’s arm and run through an automated
            process that removes the plasma portion from the blood. The remaining red blood cells and
            platelets are then returned to the donor’s arm with a small amount of saline to maintain the
            overall volume. This all occurs while the donor is in the donation chair and allows a donor to
            give more plasma than they would during a regular blood donation – enough plasma for up to three
            patients from a single plasma donation. The process itself is safe, and ultimately is very
            similar to a general blood donation visit.
